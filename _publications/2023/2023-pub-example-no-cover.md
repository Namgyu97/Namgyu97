abstract: >-
  We propose a multimodal fusion approach for news categorization, combining image and text data to enhance classification accuracy in digital journalism.
  Among the evaluated methods, early fusion achieved the best performance with 78.13% accuracy and an F1 score of 0.7810, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating modalities.
