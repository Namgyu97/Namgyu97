#  We propose KMG-InvAttack, a novel inversion attack scenario designed for ECG-based user authentication systems, capable of extracting 40% of private ECG information using only public data in a black-box environment.
#  This highlights significant vulnerabilities in such systems, with a 43.4% higher extraction rate than existing baselines, underscoring the need for enhanced privacy protection.
