#  We present a lightweight transformer model with shared embeddings between encoders and decoders, designed to enhance efficiency and address expression imbalance in construction safety prediction.
#  The model reduces parameters by 48% compared to conventional transformers and improves performance by 4% over LSTM, enabling effective correlation analysis and deployment in edge computing environments.
