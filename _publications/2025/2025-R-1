#  We present a dual-stream model combining Conv1D with skip connections and modified GRUs, enhanced by Spatial and Soft Attention mechanisms, for electricity price forecasting.
#  The model demonstrates superior performance, significantly reducing prediction errors across regions like New South Wales (69.33% MAE reduction) and Tasmania (16.18% MAE reduction).
