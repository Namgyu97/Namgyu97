#  We propose a context-aware hyper-personalized recommendation system for kiosk IoT devices, addressing data imbalance across domains with an efficient self-supervised learning method.
#  The system demonstrated a 20% improvement in performance metrics and an additional 0.8% gain with self-supervised learning, ensuring high-quality recommendations and optimal resource usage.
