abstract: >-
  We present a dual-stream model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (Conv1D) with skip connections and modified Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), integrating Spatial and Soft Attention mechanisms for accurate electricity price forecasting.
  The proposed approach outperforms traditional methods, demonstrating its effectiveness on real-world electricity market data.
