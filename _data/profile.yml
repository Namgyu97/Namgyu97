  <p>
    I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Engineering at Gachon University, specializing in Knowledge Inference and Graph Representation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently, my research focuses on video understanding, emphasizing the utilization of scene graphs and knowledge graphs to model semantic relationships 
    and contextual dependencies in visual data. This research tackles key challenges such as data sparsity, domain variability, and scalability 
    in dynamic environments. By employing graph-based reasoning and structured representations, I aim to bridge the gap between low-level perceptual data 
    and high-level semantic abstraction, advancing the field of video analysis.
  </p>
  <p>
    I am open to collaborating with scholars and researchers interested in advancing methodologies and applications in visual understanding. 
    Please feel free to reach out regarding potential collaborative opportunities.
