  <p>
    I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at Gachon University, specializing in Knowledge Inference and Graph Representation.
  </p>
  <p>
    My research focuses on video understanding.
    I utilize scene and knowledge graphs to model semantic relationships and contextual dependencies.
    I address challenges like data sparsity, domain variability, and scalability in dynamic environments, aiming to bridge the gap between low-level visual data and high-level semantic abstraction.
  </p>
  <p>
    I welcome collaboration with scholars and researchers in visual understanding.
    Please feel free to contact me about potential opportunities.
  </p>
